## About the Video Course
Drupal is without a doubt the leading open source CMS today. With its huge usage and user base as well as the large number of add-ons, it can be adapted to suit the needs of most modern websites. Furthermore, thanks to the nature of the Drupal.org website itself, it is much easier these days to make sound decisions on what add-ons to use that will meet sustainability requirements in the future.

Drupalâ€™s highly adaptable nature in managing sites is greatly desired. However, it is quite different than other CMS software as it is also intended to act as a CMF. That initial learning curve when first starting to use Drupal is the challenge that seems to dissuade designers from using it. With Building a Website with Drupal, you will learn everything you need to know about how to build a website using Drupal, beginning with installing a test server, building a prototype and custom theme, all the way through to deployment. Topics such as the usage of views and other common add-ons, downloading editor files and the WYSIWYG module, and integrating the open source Tiny MCE editor are covered.

Building a Website with Drupal is aimed at those with web designer skills wishing to learn how to use Drupal to build sites. Beginning with a tour of the Drupal site, the attention shifts to establishing a web test server that is setup to house the prototype. Various customization topics are covered for content types, menus, and views. Building a custom theme without writing any PHP is covered next. The final steps of this course include prep work for migration to an actual web server.

Surmount the initial learning curve associated with building sites using Drupal by studying how a community site is put together.
